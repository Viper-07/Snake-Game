- **Modern UI**: Gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism effects
- **Keyboard Controls**: Arrow keys or WASD for movement
- **Game Controls**: Start, Pause, and Reset functionality
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated snake with shiny effects and circular food

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click "Start Game" to begin
3. Use arrow keys or WASD to control the snake
4. Eat the red food to grow and increase your score
5. Avoid hitting the walls or yourself
6. Use spacebar or "Pause" button to pause/resume
7. Click "Reset" to restart the game

## Technologies Used
